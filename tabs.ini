; This is where you can define pagers with tabs you want to repeat 
;
; Each section is a mix you want represented with a tab
; Pager is the id of the pager on which you want this mix to act. 
;    This is useful for having multiple pagers with different controls
; Label corresponds to the name of the tab and what the user sees
